# Sales-Analyzer
This project analyzes sales data from an ice cream parlour to provide insights into business performance. It calculates the total sales, monthly sales totals, and identifies the most popular and revenue-generating items on a monthly basis. Additionally, it provides statistics for the most popular item each month, including the minimum, maximum, and average number of orders.

The program reads data from a CSV file and outputs the results in a readable format, offering valuable insights into customer preferences and revenue patterns for the ice cream parlour.
